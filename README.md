## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Intuitive GUI**: A simple graphical interface for all operations, no command line needed.
- **Dynamic Rule Editor**: Add, edit, or paste replacement rules (`old_text|new_text`) directly within the application.
- **Multiple Replacement Strategies**:
  - **`precise`**: (Default) Accurately finds and replaces text, preserving original fonts, sizes, and colors.
  - **`overlay`**: Covers the original text with a white rectangle before writing the new text, ensuring maximum compatibility.
  - **`hybrid`**: Automatically selects the best strategy for each replacement.
- **Custom Font Support**: Simply place your `.ttf` or `.otf` font files into the `fonts` folder to use them in replacements.
- **Live Logging**: See the replacement process, counts, and any potential issues in real-time.
- **Result Verification**: Optionally verify that all instances of the old text have been removed after the process is complete.
- **Standalone `.exe`**: Packaged with PyInstaller to run on Windows without a Python environment.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Build (For Developers)

If you want to run from source or rebuild the application, follow these steps.

### 1. Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ installed.
- Git installed.

### 2. Clone & Setup Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo

# Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv .venv
# On Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install pyinstaller
```

### 4. Run from Source

```bash
python gui.py
```

### 5. Package into an .exe File

Make sure the `fonts` folder (with any custom fonts) is in the project root. Then, run the following command:

```bash
pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile --name "PDF Replacer" --add-data "fonts;fonts" gui.py
```
- `--noconsole`: Prevents the command-line window from appearing when the .exe is run.
- `--onefile`: Bundles everything into a single executable file.
- `--add-data "fonts;fonts"`: Ensures the `fonts` folder is included in the package.

The final `PDF Replacer.exe` will be located in the `dist` folder.

## ÂëΩ‰ª§Ë°åÁî®Ê≥ï (È´òÁ∫ß)

For automation or batch processing, you can use the core script directly from the command line. This requires a separate text file for rules.

**Usage:**
```bash
python pdf_replacer_pymupdf.py <input_pdf> <output_pdf> <rules_file> [--method <method>] [--verify]
```

**Example:**
```bash
# Use the default 'precise' method and verify the result
python pdf_replacer_pymupdf.py document.pdf document_updated.pdf rules.txt --verify
```
